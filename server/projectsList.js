    description:`Accuweights is a renowned technical services provider that caters for various industrial requisites 
    such as repair and calibration of measuring equipment. I revamped their website to give it a more modern look and feel.`,
    caseStudy:`The Accurate Weigtech company website was developed over a decade ago. Since then, newer tools, design principles, and UX guidelines
    had hit the market. Consequently, it was necessary for the website to have a newer and more modern look and feel to help the company maintain an online presence
    and retain its clients. I helped redesign the website, adding a few more features it lacked before, such as the map indicating the exact location of the company
    premises. The new user interface was inspired by design ideas from other websites in the same industry as my client's. Feel free to check out the project via

    description:`I fully replicated the Kabarak University student portal. The front-end is entirely similar to the actual portal,
     while I used the student flow within the system to try and build the backend.`,
    caseStudy:`For a long time, I had been fascinated by Javascript and its application in real-world scenarios. Having been introduced to the language as soon as 
    I began learning web development, I was a bit down-fallen that I could not use it across the board to build a full-stack application. However, as I delved deeper
    into developing web applications, I came across Node.js and the MERN tech stack. In a bid to master this stack and finally use Javascript for both 
    frontend and backend, I decided to replicate my Alma Mater, Kabarak University,'s student portal. This project provided me with a real test on how to implement
    my Javascript, problem-solving, and critical-thinking skills. The development of this portal is still underway and open for contributions from other Javascript
    developers`,

    core library basics using this game. Currently, the game can only be played by two people in the same location. I plan to introduce a multiplayer, 
    online feature soon`,
